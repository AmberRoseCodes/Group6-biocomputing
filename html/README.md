The purpose of this layer is to transform the data in database and business logic layer and visualise at the front end. The index.py file comprises of images, displaying all entries and search feature for database to find an GenBank accession for individual entries such as gene identifier, protein product names, GenBank accession, or chromosomal location.


This directory contains only the HTML file for the initial view of the
database. 

There would be an `html2` directory if there is an alternative front end.

In this example, it has been implemented as a Python script so it can
access the configuration information - running this script generates
the HTML (this is done by the install script)
